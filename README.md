Weekly Challenge 1: Excel
In this challenge I reformatted Crowdfunding data to be easier to read visually. 
I created three pivot tables that explored the relationship of outcome to category, subcategory, and month of event launch.
I created a line graph and table that examined the relationship between the monetary goal and outcome of the campaign.
I examined central tendencies and variance in the backers of the campaigns based on successes and failures.
